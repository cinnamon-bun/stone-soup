/*
    Experiments in lifecycle management for classes.

    What happens when you need to do some async setup for your class,
    but a constructor can't be an async function?

    We use an async hatch() function to do this setup / initialization,
    but the user has to remember to call it, and remember to await it.

    Also how does this integrate with an object that can close()?

    Here are some ways to do it:
